| Affiliation | Organizations involved in scientific research. |
| Scholarly sourcess    | Journals, conferences, or websites.       |
|Field of Study |	Specific area of academic research or expertise.|

This diagram shows the possible relationships between different entities, with a paper as the central focus of the minimal whole.


## Relationships Among Same Entities
![com1](img/KGen_01.png)
Relationships between papers include "cites" and "is cited by", which can expand into an entire knowledge graph network.

![com2](img/KGen_02.png)
Relationships between researchers, for co-authors of the same paper, can be identified as "collaborators".

![com3](img/KGen_03.png)
Relationships between scholarly sourcess, for journals and conferences in the same research field, can be identified as "Co field".

![com4](img/KGen_04.png)
Relationships between field of Study,if the fields are related, we mark the relationship as "related"

![com5](img/KGen_05.png)
if two fields have a hierarchical relationship, we use the term 'Branch of' to describe the relationship
