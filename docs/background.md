# Background of the ReadPaper Academic Graph

The growth of academic resources has entered an era of rapid development, with the latest academic papers emerging daily across various fields. Just on Arxiv alone, there are over 8,000 papers submitted each month. Managing and utilizing these academic resources is a challenging issue.

Meanwhile, AI applications implemented using the traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) process do not effectively leverage the vast amount of academic literature for reasoning. Using a Knowledge Graph (KG) to assist reasoning in large models has become an important task.

In response to these contemporary challenges, our ReadPaper Academic Graph was born.
